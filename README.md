# JScontrols
A small js control library.

This library is a small, personal project that i am working on in my free time for purposes of delving deeper into Javascript, i intend to re-implement the whole package in Angular, React, Vue and Blazor.NET in the future to further my personal understanding of these frameworks and how to use them.

## To Do
These to do's are not in order of priority...
* Basic Form functionality
  * Allows user to create a form from a small config input.
  * Call a simple method to pull out the inputted data as an object.
* Basic modal functionality
  * Create a modal from a small config input.
  * Emitted events for each button specified in the config.
  * Consider extra functionality here.
* Basic Form Slider (Because who really likes ugly check boxes?)
  * Create with a simple function call, no config required.
  * true/false.
* Basic toast messages
  * Create toast message on demand based on config.
  * Set area of the site to place top left, top center, top right, bottom left, bottom center, bottom right.
  * Set width.
  * Set colour ( via css ).
* Basic Image Carousel 
  * Create an Image carousel.
  * Possibly achievable with just CSS3?
* Basic Data Grid functionality
  * Create a basic table from a small config input
  * Allow adding, deleting, updating of rows. (inline and as a modal form?)
    * Emit event on each action, pass the "old" and "new" data to the method.
  * Call a simple method to pull out the data stored in the table.
